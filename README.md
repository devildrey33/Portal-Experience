# Portal-Experience
This experience its based on https://threejs-journey.com/ chapter 6 Portal Scene 

- Uses my own model and texture
- Has an extended portal fragment shader to make an initial animation for opening the portal
- Has an extra particles with vertex and fragment shader to simulate a very basic kabush effect on the initial portal animation
- You can tweak those shader values to achieve different effects
